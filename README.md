# Recent Instagram to Jekyll/GitHub Pages

A rather crude script to update my blogs with the latest photos from Instagram, based on the tags included in the photo.

I run this hourly using the [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) which uses [One-off Dynos](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/one-off-dynos) for the invocation.
